# United States Census Bureau
### I will introduce The United States Census Bureau because Iâ€™ve used it before for a few projects. This website has all the census data taken in the US from a multitude of years, a massive amount of data. For a project relating poverty to crime in LA using Postgresql I used data that showed low income to high income housing in different precincts and also categorized families whether they were single parent households

# Fundamental Numerical Methods and Data Analysis by George W. Collins, II
### The book I will introduce is called Fundamental Numerical Methods and Data Analysis by George W. Collins, II. This book will give you a nice baseline knowledge of how to perform data analysis. The reason I am interested in this book is because it is for beginners and focuses on the fundamentals, which I need to learn.
